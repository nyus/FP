v 1.0
test pull statuses, test the expiration functionality of the statuses

display profile picture

//display post username

//cell shrinks size when there is no image----ok
//For minute options because we are starting of we need to make them longer so how about 0-10 min and then add 15 min 20 min and a 30 min option?

//potential in v 1.0
//A revive button maybe next to the timer that looks similar to it in banner form. (It's very similar to retweet/Share but the original timer will restart)

                                                                                  
#warning revisit
//A filter to allow users to see posts by time left Like ebay style

//time label is cut off

//add photo crashes the app

//user should be able to see his own statuses

//add friend feedback

//have a local count of number of dwindles the user have, as the same time post that to server. counting number of status is too pricy

perhaps also store user status to local, so that we can avoid pulling too many past

user can only send message to people who allow the user to follow

v 2.0
                                                                                  
after a friends is added, send notification

A Reply button (It's like a comment feature but called reply)
                
Is it possible to have all your posts remain in your history but in no one elses. (Like your personal wall will show what you posted and what people said...So if u post something u can come back to it but u can't go back to someone elses)
                                                                                   
A like button but I wanna call it something else... not sure what though
